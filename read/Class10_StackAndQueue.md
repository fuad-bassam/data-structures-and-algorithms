# Stacks and Queues

Create Stacks and Queues Classes that have functionality like the build-in ones  


## Challenge

try to create our own Stacks and Queues Classes With them behaviors and The same Time & Space complexity as the build-in classes

## Approach & Efficiency

in this code try to avoid any behavior that Stacks and Queues didn't do , the Time O(1) and the Space O(n).
## API

1. we use the node from the previous codes.

2. Create a Stacks class that contains.

   - Property `Node` top for taking the first node of any stack.
   - Method `push` to add element in the stack.
   - Method `pop` to return and remove from the stack.
   - Method `peek` to return the value of the top of the stack **first element**.
   - Method `isEmpty` to check if the Stack is null or not.
    

3. Creat Stacks class that contain.

- Property `Node` front for taking the first node of any Queue.
- Property `Node` rear for taking the last node of any Queue.
- Method `enqueue` to add an element at the first of Queue.
- Method `dequeue` to remove the last element in the Queue.
- Method `peek` to return the value of the rear of the Queue **Last element**.
- Method `isEmpty` to check if the Queue is null or not.
