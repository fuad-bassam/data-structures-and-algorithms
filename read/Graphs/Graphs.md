# Graphs
this code is to use the Graphs concepts and algorithm   
## Challenge

this challenge to create a graph class with the main operation that we can use it 

## Approach & Efficiency

- time complexity for all the program: O(n) 
- space complexity for all the program:O(1)

## API

- `add` : to add element to the graph
- `addEdge`: to add edges between nodes
            have two override one with `weight` and the other without it 
- `getNodes`: return a list of all nodes in the graph
- `getNeighbors`: that return the nodes that are connected with an edge for specific node   
- `size`: return how many nodes in the graph
